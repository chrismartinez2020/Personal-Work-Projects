# Personal-Work-Projects
This is a repository containing projects for work as well as a personal portfolio. These projects are in addition to daily job duties as an I.T. Technician because I have experience and knowledge in programming using Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Linux, Batch, PowerShell & C++ (OOP). 

## 1st Project - Call-Log Form v5 - wMetrics.xlsm
The Call-Log excel document which was created using VBA was an idea requested by JCP HR to automate as much of the form for specific users to cutdown on time filling out the form.

### Additional features to be added
In the future, I will automate the creation of graphs in the excel spreadsheet using Python. This is currently a work in progress. 


## 2nd Project - Countdown Timer
The countdown timer consist of a css, javascript, html and a python file. The python file is used for automating the opening of the html file and the javascript consist of the code used for counting down the time for each period. 
The CSS file is used for formatting text in the html file. 
File Names:
Counter.css
TimerCode.js
index.html
main.py

### Additional features to be added
Creating the entire countdown timer in either JAVA or Python as an executable.
Also, allowing the user to set the times for each period for the packing department.
